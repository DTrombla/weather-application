# weather-application
This is a weather application.

When the user opens the application for the first time they will see a placeholder page where the values of all application variables are "Place Holder," when they search a city the application requests the weather information about that city and displays it on the page.

The city they typed in will be added to their search history on the left udnerneath the search bar. 

The user may click on any element in their search history to see weather information about that city.

Whenever the user reloads the page or revisits the page another time, the last city they looked at will be displayed on the page, and visible in the search history while the rest are wiped. 

note: I had to use duplicate classes for styling forcast blocks, using classes broke it for some bootstrappy reason I assume.

Enjoy the weather! https://dtrombla.github.io/weather-application/
